# ArduBT-Controller plus ULTRA
# Arduino-Bluetooth-Controller plus ULTRA

# COMPATIBLE FOR
  - HC 05 Bluetooth Classic Module
  - HC 06 Bluetooth Classic Module
  - HM 10 Bluetooth Low Energy Module
  
# 3 MODES
  - SWITCH ON/OFF MODE
  - GAMEPAD MODE 
    - 4 Arrow button and 4 diagonal for omnidrive
    - Analog joystick button
    - IP CAM Video VIEWER
  - VOICE RECOGNITION MODE
  
 more modes in progress

 ok why plus ultra? cuz im a big fan of all might(Plus ultra means go beyond your limit). :) 

 So there's a lot of arduino bluetooth controller in googlestore(play store) but there's limited buttons, functions and also limited to hc05 only or hm10 only. So i made this app to circumvent those problems whehe. This app is for those who has two types of bluetooth module and dont want to download each app specifically for that BT module. 

 This app makes you control your Arduino projects like RC car or any IOT applications using your mobile phone thru bluetooth.

 All the files (apk, circuit, program, codes) are all provided) :)

# Compatible with android 4.4.4 (API 19) to android 10(API 29). 
# Compatible from Bluetooth 2.0 to Bluetooth 5.0.

This app is under beta test.  Any bugs or error can be reported or send to my email. (engrpandaece@gmail.com)

# NOTE: Important. 
Before uploading to arduino disconnect first any connection in PIN D0 & D1 (TX,RX).

#
## 1 SWITCH ON OFF MODE
PARTS REQUIRED: 
- ARDUINO UNO or similar
- Anything Digital OUTPUT i.e LED's, Relay etc.
- Some resistors

#
## 3 VOICE RECOGNITION MODE

This mode lets the user control IOT applications using voice command thru arduino.(NEED INTERNET)


This mode use google tts & speech recognition. Make sure the device has it. Any Language can be recognized based on your phone google recognition. Voice text and arduino text code must be the same for it to work (Case sensitive).
